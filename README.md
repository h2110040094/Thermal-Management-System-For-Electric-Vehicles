# Electric Vehicle Battery Fire Safety System

## Introduction
Electric Vehicle unexpected Battery Fire Accident can cause loss of human life and damage to Electric vehicles. It often happens when Electric Vehicle users are not alerted immediately. To address this issue, we have developed a system that monitors the battery temperature and smoke levels in Electric Vehicles and alerts users promptly to prevent accidents and damages.

## Objectives
The main objectives of the Electric Vehicle Battery Fire Safety System are:
1. **Monitoring Battery Conditions**: Continuously monitor the temperature and smoke levels of the Electric Vehicle battery.
2. **Alert Mechanism**: Alert users immediately through a buzzer and smartphone notifications upon detecting abnormal battery conditions.
3. **Auto Cut-off**: Implement an auto cut-off mechanism to disconnect the battery power from the Electric Vehicle in case of emergency to prevent further damages.

## Functionality
The system operates as follows:
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Sensors are installed to monitor the temperature and smoke levels of the battery.
- **Alert Generation**: If abnormal conditions are detected, such as high temperature or presence of smoke, the system triggers an alert.
- **Alert Mechanism**: Users are alerted through a buzzer installed in the vehicle and smartphone notifications.
- **Auto Cut-off**: In case of emergency, the system automatically cuts off the battery power to prevent further damages.

## Implementation
The Electric Vehicle Battery Fire Safety System is implemented using a combination of sensors, microcontrollers, and communication modules. The system is designed to be integrated into Electric Vehicles seamlessly.

## Usage
1. Install the Electric Vehicle Battery Fire Safety System in your Electric Vehicle.
2. Ensure proper calibration and setup of the system.
3. Turn on the system before operating the Electric Vehicle.
4. Regularly monitor the smartphone notifications and heed any alerts issued by the system.
5. In case of emergency, follow the instructions provided by the system to ensure safety.

## Future Improvements
- Integration with vehicle management systems for enhanced control and monitoring.
- Development of predictive analytics to anticipate potential fire hazards.
- Implementation of remote monitoring and control features for added convenience.
